## INTRODUCTION
 
First I imported all the packages needed to explore the dataset
The dataset used can be found in this link:https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv
Next I imported the data in to the prosperloan data  into the notebook
To get a feel of the data, I explored the shape of the data, which had 113,937 rows and 81 columns.
Using the spreadsheet provided, I was able to get an overview of what each of the 81 colums were about.
Based on the knowledge of each variable represented in the columns, I selected 18 columns which were of interest to me for further analysis.

## EXPLORATION

I selected 18 of the  81 Columns for Analysis
I used univariate visualizations to observe trends within each variables such as:
	Verifiable income, Employment Status, Occupation, Loan status, Income range e.t.c
I used the bivariate distribution to probe into the relationship between certain listing categories and loan status.
I also used the boxplot, another bivariate visualization which helped in showing the relationship between income ranges and the original loan amount.
The correlation map shows a strong relationship between the original loan amount and Monthly Income.

             NB: ALL VISUALIZATIONS IN THE EXPLANATORY SLIDES WERE MADE SUBSLIDES.

## CONCLUSION

Many Calofornians live off loans trying to pay other debts, inspite of being one of the states with higher income ranges.
A 36 month period is most convenient for many to pay their loans.
I observed a higher current Loan status for peole within the debt consolidation category.
